            "body": "I mean of course. I agree with everything you said, but I also don't think its healthy to avoid trying to discover if your atypical behaviors are disordered or not. OP even stated he felt guilty for thinking he had MD. Would you apply your logic to an alcoholic? People need room to be able to acknowledge and accept they may have a problem. And plenty of people can do, have done, and don't have any other option than to do that alone, without a professional.\n\nI do agree that MD is may be more of a symptom of a disorder than a disorder itself. I have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, I dissociate in other ways as well that got me formerly diagnosed, and I believe MD may fall under the dissociative disorder umbrella. Ive also seen compelling evidence that its a symptom of OCD, too.\n\nI agree some people may take the self diagnosis way to far and try to \"cure\" themselves without ever talking to a professional (and discovering a deeper reason for their MD) but again, seeking a professional is an absolute luxury, especially now in these financial times. And making people feel guilty for even exploring the possibility their behavior may be disordered isn't going to be helpful for anyone. And I think the anti self diagnosis camp of people are ignoring privilege. \n\nSo I think the answer is to not push anti self diagnos. And instead push educating our community the best we can, and advocating for better health care so seeking professional help isn't a luxury.\n\n(Your comment btw is a perfect example of educating our community because you are ultimately correct, a lot of people in this sub seem to overlook that their MD is the tip of an iceberg of a bigger problem. Mine was my dissociative disorder. And since being diagnosed with it I've been able to manage my MD better overall)",

Sure, its not a direct action, but it does have an impact. \n\nSecond. The person who doesn't have insurance is much more likely to not be forthcoming about everything they are feeling/need/be worried about because of the costs.

He got a good job with health insurance. He got a kidney stone, was given a scan, hospitalized, a  catheter put into his kidney, and a whole operation already planned for him to have to get rid of the stones he had backed up.

            "body": "I mean of course. I agree with everything you said, but I also don't think its healthy to avoid trying to discover if your atypical behaviors are disordered or not. OP even stated he felt guilty for thinking he had MD. Would you apply your logic to an alcoholic? People need room to be able to acknowledge and accept they may have a problem. And plenty of people can do, have done, and don't have any other option than to do that alone, without a professional.\n\nI do agree that MD is may be more of a symptom of a disorder than a disorder itself. I have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, I dissociate in other ways as well that got me formerly diagnosed, and I believe MD may fall under the dissociative disorder umbrella. Ive also seen compelling evidence that its a symptom of OCD, too.\n\nI agree some people may take the self diagnosis way to far and try to \"cure\" themselves without ever talking to a professional (and discovering a deeper reason for their MD) but again, seeking a professional is an absolute luxury, especially now in these financial times. And making people feel guilty for even exploring the possibility their behavior may be disordered isn't going to be helpful for anyone. And I think the anti self diagnosis camp of people are ignoring privilege. \n\nSo I think the answer is to not push anti self diagnos. And instead push educating our community the best we can, and advocating for better health care so seeking professional help isn't a luxury.\n\n(Your comment btw is a perfect example of educating our community because you are ultimately correct, a lot of people in this sub seem to overlook that their MD is the tip of an iceberg of a bigger problem. Mine was my dissociative disorder. And since being diagnosed with it I've been able to manage my MD better overall)",

Sure, its not a direct action, but it does have an impact. \n\nSecond. The person who doesn't have insurance is much more likely to not be forthcoming about everything they are feeling/need/be worried about because of the costs.

He got a good job with health insurance. He got a kidney stone, was given a scan, hospitalized, a  catheter put into his kidney, and a whole operation already planned for him to have to get rid of the stones he had backed up.
